- Analyze total and daily trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Visualize key metrics using line charts, bar plots, and choropleth maps
- Calculate critical indicators like death rate and vaccination rate
- Add interactive features using ipywidgets or Streamlit

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Plotly (for optional choropleth)
- ipywidgets (for interactivity)
